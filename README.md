# Build an AI Agent in Python

Created this project via a follow-along tutorial as part of Boot.Dev's Back-End Developer Path.

## Purpose

Write a toy agentic code editor in Python, similar to Claude Code or Cursor's Agent Mode. 
Understand how agents work from scratch by using the Google Gemini API to create an LLM-powered code agent.

- LLMs
  - Learn how LLMs work and send prompts to the Gemini API using the Python client library
- Functions
  - Write the functions your AI agent will need to modify files and run Python code
- Function Calling
  -  Give your AI agent the ability to call functions based on its system prompt and context window
- Agents
  - Give your tool a proper feedback loop to make it truly "agentic" and fix a real bug
